# 🌐 Wix-Based Website Project
This is a personal website project developed using the Wix website builder. The exported HTML reflects key components such as the homepage, embedded widgets, and interactive elements used in the site.

## 🚀 About This Project
This project represents a visual and interactive site built using Wix, then exported to local files for reference and customization. It includes:

A styled homepage

Embedded widget popups (e.g., cart interface)

Chat components and responsive design scripts

Local resource references for offline inspection

It is intended for demonstration, documentation, or further development outside Wix's hosted environment.

## 🧩 Features
### 🖼️ Home Page Layout
A visually styled landing page exported from Wix.

### 🛒 Cart Widget Popup
A mockup of the cart widget interface used in e-commerce pages.

### 💬 Chat Integration
Placeholder for chat-based support or interactions.

### 🎨 Custom Fonts and Stylesheets
Includes font and color styles used across components.

├── index.html                 # Chat widget and styles

📌 Note: Some references in the files may point to local file paths or CDN scripts used by Wix and may not function in raw HTML unless manually hosted.

## 🧰 How to Use
You can open the .html files directly in a browser for preview. If you're planning to host it:

Replace or upload any missing assets (CSS, JS, fonts).

Adjust all file:/// or local paths to relative or absolute hosted URLs.

Optionally, use a static web host like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

## 🧠 Customization
Since the project is exported, you'll need to manually:

Replace or upload assets

Modify HTML or CSS for content and styling

Link to working versions of JavaScript and fonts
